## Points Redemption Mechanism

### How Points Work

**Earning Points:**
- Customers earn points when they make purchases at affiliated shops
- Points are calculated based on the shop's "Points per Currency Unit" rate
- Example: If rate is 5 points per $1, a $20 purchase = 100 points

**Point Types:**
1. **Total Points**: All points ever earned
2. **Redeemed Points**: Points already used for rewards
3. **Available Points**: Total Points - Redeemed Points (what you can use)

### Redemption Process

#### For Customers

1. **Check Available Points**
   - Go to Upload tab
   - View your "Available Points" in the dashboard
   - Formula: Available = Total Earned - Redeemed

2. **Request Redemption**
   - When uploading a bill, you can request to use points
   - Enter the amount of points you want to redeem
   - Points will be converted to discount (based on shop's conversion rate)

3. **Wait for Approval**
   - Shop owner must approve the redemption
   - Points are deducted only after approval
   - You'll see the transaction in your history

4. **Track Your Balance**
   - History tab shows all redemptions
   - Red "Points Redeemed" entries show deductions
   - Balance updates immediately after approval

#### For Shop Owners

1. **Review Redemption Requests**
   - Redemption requests appear in "Pending Approvals" tab
   - Shows customer name, points requested, and discount amount
   - View customer's total points and redemption history

2. **Verify Legitimacy**
   - Check if customer has sufficient available points
   - Verify the purchase is genuine
   - Ensure discount amount matches points requested

3. **Approve or Reject**
   - **Approve**: Points are deducted, discount applied
   - **Reject**: No points deducted, customer keeps points

4. **Points Calculation**
   - Set your conversion rate in Settings
   - Example: 100 points = $10 discount (10 points per $1)
   - Clearly communicate this to customers
